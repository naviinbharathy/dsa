I was working on two different projects at same time. Those are Chanakya and LPMS (Limited partner management system).

1. Project: Chanakya (Feb 2022 - Apr 2024)

Chanakya is a workflow automation tool aimed at streamlining task and compliance management. The system automates approval processes and improves communication by sending task reminders, approval status updates, and periodic reports. This ensures managers and employees are kept informed about task statuses, promoting efficient task tracking and completion across teams.

Designed and maintained user-friendly interfaces to facilitate easy task tracking and management for both managers and employees.
2. Project: Limited Partner Management System (LPMS) (Feb 2022 - Apr 2024)
Description:
LPMS is a web application designed to simplify the management of investors, including onboarding, data migration, and investment tracking. The system also handles capital calls, payment processing, and return distributions to investors. LPMS provides transparency and facilitates enhanced communication between investors and fund managers through customizable reporting and automated processes.
